The code will do the following\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item spawn\+\_\+cylinder.\+cpp will summon in the cylinder at a specified location.
\item detect\+\_\+cylinder.\+cpp will attempt to detect the cylinder.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_detect_sec}{}\doxysection{Detection Method}\label{index_detect_sec}
The executable will first read in laser scan values and will filter out \textquotesingle{}bad\textquotesingle{} readings. The next stage invovles detecting which have the potential to be a cylinder. The final stage goes through a vector of detected objects and determines the best match.
